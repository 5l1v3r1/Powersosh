Powersosh is a module which can help you do simple OSINT to find profiles online.


Either run Powersosh locally with the script or remotely: 

powershell –nop –c “iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securethelogs/Powersosh/master/powersosh.ps1’)”


Enter the username and Powersosh will search the web:
